Im assuming that you are preprocessing the image for OCR(Optical Character Recognition)

I had a project to detect license plates and these were the steps I did, you can apply 
them to your project. After greying the image try applying equalize histogram to the 
image, this allows the area's in the image with lower contrast to gain a higher contrast. 
Then blur the image to reduce the noise in the background. Next apply edge detection 
on the image, make sure that noise is sufficiently removed as ED is susceptible to it. 
Lastly, apply closing(dilation then erosion) on the image to close all the small holes 
inside the words.
